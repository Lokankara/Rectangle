//				A. Class definitions
//				B. Data
//				C. Methods
//				D. Code blocks enclosed in curly brackets
//Classes may not be static. Data and methods may be static, and often they are. When 
//the static keyword is followed by a code block, the block is a static initializer and is executed 
//when the class is loaded.
