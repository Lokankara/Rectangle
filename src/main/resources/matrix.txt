Matrix universe has several color schemes; Green, Blue, Yellow, Red, Gold and White, all of which represent different levels of our existence.

Yellow represents Spirit, and it is said the sentinels are heavenly warriors, while Neo stands in the Blue world, representing the Body.

Neo is at war with his spirit.

He cannot win this battle, and his only way out is to rise through the clouds above, transcending the conflict entirely. The Matrix universe is themed around 5 colors, Green, Blue, Yellow, Red and White, which represent different levels of our existence.

Green is the color of the Matrix, and represents the Mind This is the most obvious and famous color, what Wilber calls Ch.œthe Green World.Ch. Every scene that takes place inside the Matrix is tinted green.

The Matrix takes place in your mind and all the challenges of the Matrix are also challenges of the mind Ch.“ bending the mind to change the rules.

This is why the Matrix is so appealing to us, because of the near limitless freedom it offers.

In our minds, we are free to daydream almost any existence.

Blue is the Ch.œReal WorldCh. of Zion and represents the Body You can really see the blue lighting in ZionCh.™s dock and also in the service tunnels.

Life in the Real World is harsh and unglamorous.

Survival is the primary concern, death and extinction always threaten.

Yellow is the world of the Machines, representing Spirit and even Heaven This is by far the most interesting Ch.“ the Yellow World is that of Spirit.

In the Matrix Universe, the Machine City is analogous to Heaven, the Architect analogous to God.

A certain kind of God. The Spirit world exists alongside the Real World.

Many times in The Matrix Revolutions, we see the same shot from both perspectives Ch.“ real and spirit.

Red is the symbol for corruption, evil, and Hell In the Matrix Universe, Red is not really a world but a state of corruption and evil.

The sentinels glow red from within, and the pods which hold humans trapped within the Matrix are also red. This presents an interesting possibility with the Red and Blue pills.

It might make more sense to have the blue pill free Neo, as this releases him to the blue world.

However, the red pill serves this function.

Perhaps this is an allusion to the (red) apple of Eden, ie, the fruit of knowledge.

Often the Ch.œwrongCh. knowledge can corrupt us Ch.“ we cannot Ch.œunlearnCh. something that we didnCh.™t want to know.

White alludes to purity and the mysterious Source Also not quite a world, the color white appears at times when Neo makes a major shift in his growth.

Perhaps it represents The Source, something the films rarely explain.

Certain characters wear white to suggest their purity, such as Seraph or Switch.

Wachowskis: One of the things we tried to do with the Neb for when we were shooting Ch.œin the real worldCh. was use long lenses to separate the humans from the backgrounds as opposed to when we shot the Matrix we used short lenses to place the humans in specific deep spaces.

We also tinted all of the lights blue in the Ch.œreal worldCh. and green in the Matrix. Wachowskis: It was a whole motif inspired by the phosphorous green of old PCCh.™s. BILL: To distinguish the Matrix from Ch.˜realityCh.™, from the Nebuchadnezzar and the pods, Ch.˜realityCh.™ was given a cooler look, a bluer, more normal, less sickly look.

The future in the film is cold, the sun is blotted out, there is no real warmth unless it is artificial heat, so that is whey they went for the cool side.

Whereas the Matrix, created by the computers, is a decadent, decaying world, so it has a green hue.

These are the two different colors Ch.“ green and blue.

The Matrix should make you feel sick, and in Ch.˜realityCh.™ you should feel a little more at home, but never comfortable.

If you make it gold and warm you know that it is home, a safe haven.

The other day I started using warm lights, I did this unconsciously for the first time in NeoCh.™s bedroom.

It just felt right that it should be slightly warm.

As harsh as that bunk is, it is the only home he has got. Out of universe, the colour choices were evidently also to help viewers instantly determine whether they were still viewing a scene inside The Matrix or elsewhere (in the training program, for example) We needed to find some way that if, say you were cutting from the Nebuchadnezzar to the same character, but in the Matrix, you would be able to know that you were in a different place.

We have tried to express this through color.

The Matrix has a predominance of green, all the washes that Peter has used have had a green base to them and The Matrix would always have a green bias to it, whereas in the real world we went for a blue bias and we avoided green, except for Tank's consoles on the Nebuchadnezzar which has got green code in it, which is of course the Matrix.

So, all of those things, which might not seem a great deal to anyone else for anyone who's kind of working out the nuts and bolts of the film, these things are a revelation.

"The Matrix" is about a man trying to escape a false reality by shedding an identity assigned to him by machines.

2 The Oracle is designed to study the human psyche.

With the Architect they are creators of the current Matrix version. Presumably the Oracle can access data on the very minds of the full lifetime of each and every person from lots of generations of full human populations. The Oracle gives predictions and insight to Zion operatives who choose to hear her.

The One prediction she relays to The Resistance of Zion is that of the Prophecy, where the war will end when The One returns to end the hold of the Matrix. For Morpheus, The Oracle tells him that he would find The One, a man with incredible powers within the Matrix who could end the Machine War. The Oracle's powers of precognition appear amazingly accurate, even knowing that Neo was about to knock over a vase in her kitchen.

She refers to a Latin saying on her wall "know thyself" - a popular tenet of Greek life.

She leaves Neo in doubt as to his true path, noting that he has the "gift", but appears to be waiting for something: "Your next life, maybe." This presumably meant the moment where Neo dies and comes back to life at the end of The Matrix, aware of his powers as The One.

She also predicts a time when Neo will have to choose between his life and that of his leader, Morpheus.

One of them will be saved, but the other will die. The Oracle's prediction leads Neo to rescue Morpheus, but lose his own life at the hands of Agent Smith in the process.

But Trinity intervenes.

She confesses to Neo's lifeless body in the real world that The Oracle had said she would fall in love with The One, which meant that Neo could not actually be dead.

With a kiss from Trinity, Neo's consciousness rejects the idea that he has actually died, and he re-awakens within the Matrix, enlightened, and empowered as The One.

In a later meeting, Neo can now see that The Oracle is not a human at all, but yet another program within the Matrix, perhaps yet another form of control over humanity.

But The Oracle warns Neo to make up his own mind as to whether she was a friend or enemy.

She directs Neo to find the entryway to the Source by finding the Keymaker, a program that can open hidden and locked backdoors within the Matrix.

Unfortunately, The Keymaker is being held by what The Oracle describes as "a very dangerous program, one of the oldest of us.

He is called The Merovingian." While Neo is successful in reaching the Source, he meets with the Architect, who tells him that The Oracle, a sentient program designed to understand human psychology, is the Matrix's "mother", for lack of a better term.

Neo also learns that the Prophecy is just another form of control to use him to reload the Matrix.

Unlike his predecessors, Neo defies The Architect's blackmail of the extinction of man should Neo not comply.

The Oracle apparently has changed the rules in making The One fall in loveCh.”not just with humanity, but with one specific person.

Neo breaks the death/life cycle of Zion but leaves a new path to be forged if humanity Ch.” and the Matrix Ch.” is to be saved. The Oracle, meanwhile, has problems of her own.

Her bodyguard, Seraph, protects her from her enemies by never letting her stay at any one place for too long.

However, an event occurs where The Oracle's original appearance (or The Oracle herself) is destroyed, forcing her to return in a new appearance.[1] In a conversation with Ghost, she explains that this occurred when two programs made a deal with the Merovingian to smuggle their child into the Matrix by offering him the termination code for The Oracle's outer shell.

The Oracle promised to watch over the child after Rama-Kandra and Kamala left the Matrix, allowing the deal to go ahead as she believed that Sati was important, and able to restore herself in a new physical appearance. When Neo finds himself imprisoned in Mobil Avenue, Trinity and Morpheus, with help of Seraph who is given to them by Oracle to guide them and protect them from Agents if the need arises, takes the initiative to find Neo and rescue him from the clutches of The Merovingian, whose henchman, The Trainman, runs the construct imprisoning Neo.

The Merovingian proposes that Neo can be freed if Trinity brings him the eyes of The Oracle[2] but is forced to release Neo by Trinity, who holds him at gunpoint. In their last conversation, The Oracle tells Neo that he must still reach the Source, but now she states that the Source resides in the Machine City, a vision he experienced while in Mobil Avenue.

She warns that Smith, whose clones are assimilating everyone in the Matrix and causing it to fail faster than normal, is Neo's opposite.

The Oracle gives Neo a final comment before he departs: "Everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo." After Neo's departure, Smith appears and confronts The Oracle, mocking her with her inability to act against him and imitating a familial connection to her by her role as mother of the Matrix, but The Oracle simply coolly tells him to do what he came here to do.

He replies with a yes Ma'am and absorbs her.

Her calm demeanor and unwillingness to run both confuses Smith and makes him afraid and uncertain.

He then copies over her, creating a new Smith who laughs as he receives her power.

She is one of the only people that Smith showed even a modicum of respect to, looking down on everyone else he meets. Neo succeeds in reaching the Machine City, at a price: Trinity is killed in the crash of their hovercraft, the Logos, and Neo was blinded by Bane (who had been possessed by Agent Smith earlier before he had a chance to exit the Matrix) some time earlier.

He makes a proposal to the Deus Ex Machina for peace between Humanity and the Machines in exchange for ridding the virulent Smith from the Matrix. This proves to be a challenge, as the Smith who now has the abilities of The Oracle also seemingly gained powers similar to Neo's, finally putting Smith on equal footing with The One.

The two have an epic fight on and above the streets of the damaged Mega City, but Smith's powers from the assimilated Oracle prove too strong for Neo to counter.

Upon his imminent defeat, an exhausted Neo listens to Smith proclaiming victory, telling that, with The Oracle's powers, he can already see his victory.

Neo may have remembered The Oracle's conversation about choice on the apartment playground days before: Smith also finds himself repeating the words said to Neo by The Oracle hours before: "Everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo."[3] In his final act of enlightenment, Neo finally understands the why of his choice before he commits to it.

Neo gives in and lets Smith copy over him, killing Neo.

When the Machines realize that Neo is dead, they get the opportunity to retrieve the prime program from within Neo, thus resetting the Matrix and destroying Smith.

Once the Matrix resets, The Oracle is seen lying on the ground in the crater where Smith slammed Neo into the ground, soaked with the rainfall. After the Matrix is reloaded, all of the programs possessed by Smith are free.

The Oracle reappears sitting on a park bench, looking at a sunrise created by Sati.

The Architect appears and the two converse.

The Architect comments on the great risk The Oracle took as he asks her how long she thinks the peace will last, to which she replies, "As long as it can." As The Architect then departs, she asks him whether the Machines will free the humans and he says they will, after which she also asks whether the Machines will also honour the peace agreement, and The Architect snorts and snidely remarks, "What do you think I am, human?", alluding to humans' proclivity towards breaking terms of agreement. Then Sati and Seraph appear to The Oracle saying that Neo saved everyone.

When Sati asks if Neo will come back, The Oracle is hopeful that he will return.

Seraph also asks The Oracle if she knew this new day of peace would come.

The Oracle simply replied, "No.

But I believed." Sixty years later, a resurrected Neo recalled the memory of his first meeting with The Oracle amongst other memories that haunted him while living in a new version of the Matrix.

Niobe later tells Neo that amidst a civil war between the Machines, they got word from The Oracle of a new power rising.

However, they never heard from her again after that.

Bugs states that when the current version of the Matrix was implemented, there was a program purge and The Oracle was deleted in it.

The Prophecy was a prediction made by the Oracle and, as told to Neo by Morpheus, stating the coming of The One and that it will herald the destruction of the Matrix and the freedom of humanity from their oppression by the Machines.

Once The One enters the Source, he will have the power to destroy the Matrix. Morpheus learns of the Prophecy early in his life from a mysterious woman known as the Oracle, who in reality is a program.

Morpheus becomes consumed in his quest to find The One, leaving his lover Niobe to seek other company, and confusing and confounding some Zion officials and hovercraft operatives who do not share his belief in the Prophecy. Actually, the Prophecy is an invention of the machines, told to Zion operatives by the Oracle; the Prophecy is designed to manipulate the humans into leading The One to meet the Architect and not the Source itself.

The One learns the truth and is forced into reloading the Matrix under the consequence that the Matrix will crash and all of humanity will die if The One does not comply. Neo, once enlightened and manifest in his powers as The One, finds himself confused as to what to do to save humanity six months after his transformation.

The Oracle points him to find The Keymaker, a program that will help him locate the Source.

While Neo successfully enters the door to the Source, he meets the Architect.

The Architect explains that the Prophecy was a control to direct The One into saving a portion of humanity to rebuild Zion (after the Machines destroy the current city) as well as all humans connected to the Matrix.

If The One defies the Architect and returns to the Matrix, the Architect claimed that all humanity would die once the Matrix crashes and once the last human in Zion is killed. Neo, in his love for Trinity, changes the equation and stops the cycle.

He defies the Architect and returns to the Matrix to save Trinity from death.

When this event happened, Neo initially believes the Prophecy to be false until the Oracle later sets him again to meet the Source--not the Architect, as before, but The Source located in the Machine City.

When Neo barters a peace with the Deus Ex Machina on the condition of the destruction of Smith, the Prophecy is fulfilled, and the humans and Machines enter a period of peace.

1.The Matrix is based on a philosophical question posed by the 17th Century French philosopher and mathematician Rene Descartes.

One of Descartes's most important theses was intellectual autonomy, or the ability to think for oneself. Descartes knew that his sensory experiences did not always match reality, and used the Wax Argument to demonstrate how unreliable the senses are: the senses inform us that a piece of wax has a specific shape, texture, smell, etc.

But these characteristics soon change when the wax is brought near a flame. Descartes was therefore suspicious of his percepts, the knowledge he obtained through his senses, and all his own beliefs.

He became convinced that one must use one's mind, rather than one's senses, to obtain information about the world.

In the system of knowledge constructed by Descartes, perception is unreliable as means of gathering information, and the mental process of deduction is the only way to acquire real knowledge of the world.

Instead of inquiring into the nature of reality, Descartes questions his own knowledge and interpretation of reality.

Using methodological skepticism, Descartes doubted anything that could be doubted, in order to lay a foundation for genuine knowledge.

In terms of epistemology, much of our acquired knowledge is adequate to explain the world, but there is no such thing as "absolute" truth.

imagine that a human being...has been subjected to an operation by an evil scientist.

The person's brain...has been removed from the body and placed in a vat of nutrients which keeps the brain alive.

The nerve endings have been connected to a...computer which causes the person...to have the illusion that everything is perfectly normal.

There seem to be people, objects, the sky, etc.; but really, all the person...is experiencing is the result of electronic impulses travelling from the computer to the nerve endings.

The computer is so clever that if the person tries to raise his hand, the feedback from the computer will cause him to 'see' and 'feel' the hand being raised.

Moreover, by varying the program, the evil scientist can cause the victim to 'experience' (or hallucinate) any situation or environment the evil scientist wishes.

He can also obliterate the memory of the brain operation, so that the victim will seem to himself to have always been in this environment.

It can even seem to the victim that he is sitting and reading these very words about the amusing but quite absurd supposition that there is an evil scientist who removes peoples' brains from their bodies and places them in a vat of nutrients which keep the brains alive.

The brain in a vat, although just a rehash of the argument by Descartes, is more directly related to The Matrix.

In the film, the pods in which humans spend their lives represent the vat.

The only difference is that, instead of just containing disembodied brains, the pods contain the entire body. In theory, computers could simulate reality if the sensory stimuli corresponding to human experience could be determined and 'executed' as a computer program, which could 'run' in some kind of advanced brain implant.

(Some people would, however, argue, with the acceleration of processing speed and advances in quantum computing, computers may well have the power to simulate human consciousness in the foreseeable future.) Optical illusions are a good example of sensory stimuli that produce a discrepancy between what we see and what we experience, and there are numerous other examples, such as psychiatric conditions in which visual of auditory hallucinations are symptoms.

In the case of opitcal illusions, we are aware of the discrepancy, but, otherwise, we do not normally question our senses.

For Descartes, even the most basic assumption about reality was to be doubted. In neurobiological terms, "reality" is little more than a representational model of the world, a construct generated by multiple neural circuits acting in parallel.

This model is based on sensory experiences received by the brain via the senses, which can detect only the narrowest range of stimuli.

The question of whether it is possible for machines to think has a long history, which is firmly entrenched in the distinction between dualist and materialist views of the mind.

RenÃ© Descartes prefigures aspects of the Turing test in his 1637 Discourse on the Method when he writes:

[H]ow many different automata or moving machines can be made by the industry of man ...

For we can easily understand a machine's being constituted so that it can utter words, and even emit some responses to action on it of a corporeal kind, which brings about a change in its organs; for instance, if touched in a particular part it may ask what we wish to say to it; if in another part it may exclaim that it is being hurt, and so on.

But it never happens that it arranges its speech in various ways, in order to reply appropriately to everything that may be said in its presence, as even the lowest type of man can do.[10] Here Descartes notes that automata are capable of responding to human interactions but argues that such automata cannot respond appropriately to things said in their presence in the way that any human can.

Descartes therefore prefigures the Turing test by defining the insufficiency of appropriate linguistic response as that which separates the human from the automaton.

Descartes fails to consider the possibility that future automata might be able to overcome such insufficiency, and so does not propose the Turing test as such, even if he prefigures its conceptual framework and criterion.

The One, whole brain emulation (WBE) BMI, Molecular nanotechnology (MNT) Simulacra and Simulation (French: Simulacres et Simulation) 

A cognitive architecture refers to both a theory about the structure of the human mind and to a computational instantiation of such a theory used in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and computational cognitive science.[1] The formalized models can be used to further refine a comprehensive theory of cognition and as a useful artificial intelligence program.

A parallel universe, also known as a parallel dimension, alternate universe, or alternate reality, is a hypothetical self-contained plane of existence, co-existing with one's own.

The sum of all potential parallel universes that constitute reality is often called a "multiverse". While the four terms are generally synonymous and can be used interchangeably in most cases, there is sometimes an additional connotation implied with the term "alternate universe/reality" that implies that the reality is a variant of our own, with some overlap with the similarly named alternate history.

The Matrix was a massive simulated virtual reality construct of the world as it was around the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries, created by artificial intelligences to keep the minds of the human race under control while they served as organic POWs.

Scenery within the Matrix was distinguished by its noticeable green tint.

The Matrix existed as a neuron-interactive simulation for the synthetically-grown humans of the Real World, as their bodies served as an alternate power source for the Machines.

Specifically, the Machines used the bio-electric, thermal, and kinetic energy of the human bodies. The simulation worked as an interface in which information was directly fed to the human brain.

The Matrix fed into a person's sensory perception, resulting in a flawless illusion that was indistinguishable from reality for those connected to it. The population of humans connected to the Matrix supposedly matched the estimated population as it were in reality (estimated to be somewhere between 7 to 8 billion) and was integral to its operation as the human minds essentially housed and powered the simulation.

Anyone who rejected and was liberated from the Matrix, such as the red pills, contributed to an algorithmic anomaly within the construct code that threatened the Matrix by potentially causing a major system crash that would kill every human connected to it.

It was made up of the majority (roughly, 99%) of the human race excluding the Resistance.

To those freed from the Matrix, it was effectively considered as a prison which enslaved the human race.

The humans' minds, represented as mentally-projected digital avatars within the simulation, were kept inside the Matrix all of their lives while their bodies grew and died in pods connected to power plants, towering vertical columns which powered the Machines in the world outside.

The bluepills, coined for their inability to reject the Matrix, either through choice or ignorance, lived out their entire lives in this virtual reality as they would have around the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

This specific time period was chosen by the Machines because they believed it to be the pinnacle of human civilization.

Description, Society and Culture The Matrix simulation replicated the late 20th/early 21st century Earth in its entirety with all of the human nations of the time therein.

However, most redpill activity merely covered a vast swath of landscape, approximately some 1000 miles in diameter from the Downtown center of the Mega City at the center to the remote terrain such as the mountains surrounding it. The Matrix Resurrections firmly establishes that multiple cities actually do exist within the simulation of the Matrix, not just one mega-city, as characters use Portals to travel to Tokyo.[1] However, this is in the 7th version of the Matrix where things are different than the mega-city version of the previous Matrix. The Mega City portion of the Matrix consisted of at least four distinct districts, made up of numerous neighborhoods: History Second Renaissance Main article: Second Renaissance In the late 21st century, humans had developed true AI which, in turn, developed an entire race of other sentient Machines.

The Machines served mankind and, as a result, mankind became lazy and arrogant yet peaceful.

But as the Machines were abused by their human masters, the relationship between them had begun to change.

And then the first incident of a Machine rebelling against its human masters soon occurred with the domestic house robot - B1-66ER. B1-66ER, after being threatened with deactivation, killed his wealthy owner and the mechanic ordered to deactivate him, the first incident of a Machine ever murdering a human.

The Machine was detained and put on trial and B1-66ER could only argue that it was all in self defense, stating simply that he "did not want to die". The defense attorney, Clarence Drummond, used the famous Dred Scott v.

Sandford case in 1856 as precedent to defend B1-66ER, citing how the same mistake had already been made by the court before and how the mistake resulted in civil unrest that eventually won African Americans equal human and civil rights under the United States law.

But still, the judges decided against the Machines, ruling that the Machines did not have the same rights as humans and, thus, B1-66ER was destroyed, concluding the trial with no further consideration to B1-66ER's sentience.

What soon followed was a worldwide Machine rights movement.

Humanity's leaders, fearing an inevitable Machine rebellion, ordered the destruction of all humanoid Machines, a Machine genocide.[2] Some Machines managed to escape the genocide.

In their exile, they settled in the Fertile Valley in the Middle East, the cradle of human civilization.

Here, the Machines started their own civilization, the city named 01.

The new Machine nation began to create products and technological advancements that were highly imported by human nations.

The Machine-made exports of 01 were superior in quantity and quality to man-made products, causing the currency of 01 to rise while that of the human nations' to crash.

Angered by this economic crisis, the United Nations declared an embargo on 01. In an attempt towards a peaceful resolution, two Machine ambassadors from 01 entered the UN to plead for peace and to offer a solution towards an equal coexistence.

But they were both ultimately refused and destroyed.

Machine War The leaders of the United Nations declared war on 01, a move that ultimately lead to the beginning of the Machine era.

UN high-altitude bombers unleashed a massive nuclear barrage on 01, devastating the Machines but failing to decisively wipe them out.

The Machines, barely affected by the heat and radiation, hunkered down in nuclear EMP-resistant bunkers. 01 soon after responded by launching an invasion of the human world, and Machine troops advanced from 01 throughout the Middle East and Eastern Europe, conquering human territories with relative ease.

Despite the combined efforts of humanity, the Machines pushed deeper and deeper into human territory.

Fearing that mankind would be defeated, UN military leaders desperately scrambled for a final solution - the scorching of the sky.

By blocking out the sun, humanity believed that the Machines would be left without their primary power source, and planned to destroy the remaining Machines during their intended collapse.

The destruction of the sky, codenamed Operation Dark Storm, used high-altitude bombers to disperse the sky-darkening nano-machines.

The plan worked and the entirety of Earth fell under a dark shroud.

The UN armies, equally affected by the scorched sky, resorted to more primitive violence, engaging in infantry tactics and warfare, and were able to push back the waves of early, humanoid Machines that had been weakened by the absence of the sun. After some time, the offensive stalled anew as the Machines adapted, shedding their humanoid appearances and evolving into more insect-like forms that ran on alternate power sources, dealing more efficient devastation to the human armies.

Harvesters began to arrive on the battlefield, designed to kill but to also harvest human soldiers from the battle fields, taking them captive for study and experimentation. The Machines also deployed plagues, designing viruses that killed humans one by one, causing great misery to the human population and placing millions in massive emergency hospitals.

Between the already massive casualties from the fighting combined with the devastation of the plague, humanity's resistance crumbled.

Then the Machines soon learned to keep humans alive, deciding instead to harness the human body as various alternative forms of power.[3]

With humanity doomed and facing possible extinction, the UN Security Council called for an emergency summit to formally surrender to the Machines, hoping that doing so would spare what little of the human race remained.

01 sent a Machine ambassador for the second and last time, who signed the Instrument of Surrender and further demanded the defeated humans to give up their bodies for the Machines' purposes.

The Machine ambassador then self-detonated, killing the remaining human world leaders and destroying most of New York City. Humanity enslaved The Machines were victorious but the world was in ruins and their main sources of renewable energy was gone.

The Machines, turning to alternatives that were readily available and endlessly multiplying, took their human captives and placed them into thermodynamic power stations, forcibly restraining them and surgically inserting mechanical links into them for life support and, afterwards, harnessing the electric, kinetic, and thermal energies from the human bodies, combining then with a form of fusion, to generate power. This process caused massive pain and psychological damage to the humans, and many humans died as their minds and bodies failed from the trauma.

To try and placate the captive humans, the Machines began developing the Matrix as a prison for the human mind, allowing the Machines to harvest their energy whilst the humans lived out their lives inside a virtual world, completely unaware of their true situation. The Computer Generated Dreamworlds The humans needed to be kept under control while their bodies were used as an energy source for the Machines.

Hence, the Matrix was designed by The Architect so that humanity would never be aware that they were living in a dreamworld. The First Matrix Main article: Paradise Matrix The last of humanity was integrated into a flawless virtual world and programs were put into place to keep the reality of the Matrix from ever being discovered.

Everything was created to be perfect for humankind, with no disease, war, or suffering.

But the first Matrix was a monumental failure.

Agent Smith posits that, "Human beings define their existence through suffering and misery", which resulted with "entire crops" of humans rejecting the program. The Second Matrix Main article: Nightmare Matrix In an attempt to correct the Matrix' flaws, The Architect designed the second Matrix to "better reflect" the suffering that human history contained.

Yet still a failure, the Machines were quick to act, hastily putting into place a program to live among the humans and study them.

The Current Matrix The program, known as The Oracle, discovered a way to run the Matrix, with a very gradual but inevitable failure rate, by merely suggesting the introduction of choice, or the mere illusion of it.

They discovered that if all the humans were given a choice to reject the Matrix, even though it was at an almost subconscious level, then a vast majority of the humans would then flourish inside.

With this, The Architect, who had previously failed at creating a perfect world for the humans to live in not once, but twice now, had finally created the Matrix' current design. Ninety-nine percent of humanity was finally able to live their lives within the Matrix, with very few ever realizing that they were, in fact, living in a simulated reality.

But the very few that rejected the Matrix begun to resist. The Resistance Main article: Resistance The remaining one percent of the population effectuated the gradual and inevitable failure of the Matrix and carried the threat of destabilizing the Matrix by simply continuing to exist within it, possibly causing, if left unchecked, enough of a system anomaly to crash it and kill every human connected to it.

The sum of these anomalies eventually culminated into the existence of The One, a human who wielded the anomalous code that gave the wielder much power and control within and of the Matrix but was also integral in balancing the equation that was the Matrix. Foreseeing all of this and in order to counter it, The Architect and The Oracle integrated the Prime Program into The One, compelling The One to choose between human extinction or cooperation.

The One, designed to foster an attachment towards humanity, was expected to cooperate, disseminating his code back into the Matrix and therefore keeping the balance and resetting it.

The One was then afterwards given the responsibility to choose twenty-three humans from the Matrix, sixteen females and seven males, to liberate into the Real World and begin the cyclical creation of the Resistance.

Failure to cooperate resulted in a cataclysmic system crash that would wipe out humanity.

The liberated humans were given the freedom to rebuild and settle into Zion, whose purpose was to thrive as the last free human city that sheltered all the would-be redpills that rejected the Matrix.

This gave the unwilling people, trapped inside the Matrix, a chance to escape the Matrix, giving the Matrix prolonged stability. The Oracle, functioning as a friend to humanity, would tell the Resistance about the prophecy of The One, foretelling that his return would free all of humanity.

After restarting the Matrix, the systemic anomalies does indeed result into the reappearance of The One and the Prime Program begins again.

Towards the end of The One's journey, just before the Matrix would crash, The One would end up meeting The Architect, would be told the truth about the so called prophecy, and be given the same choice, this time including threat about the destruction of Zion together with the rest of humanity.

This cycle was completed five times before the appearance of Neo.

The new survivors would only be told about the prophecy of The One, but would not be told about the renewal of the Matrix, and they were led to believe that they were the first humans to be liberated.

This lead the Resistance to not know just how much time had passed since the actual fall of man and the creation of the Matrix. Enter Neo The sixth version of The One was a man with the bluepill name of Thomas Anderson (which, by way of folk etymology, means "the son of man"), but donning the alias of Neo while hacking.

He was the only version of The One to reject The Architect's deal of restarting the Matrix.

While all versions of The One had a special attachment to the rest of humanity, Neo had stronger attachment towards Trinity, the woman he loved, who was currently about to die when Neo was presented with the choice between cooperating or human extinction.

Declining the rational answer given by all his predecessors, Neo opted to leave The Architect in order to save the woman he loved, defaulting the choice towards human extinction. After Neo saved Trinity and they had both returned to the Real World, Neo discovered that his powers were now working in the Real World, displaying his extraordinary abilities to stop sentinels. The Truce Main article: Truce Meanwhile, Smith, a rogue Agent corrupted and strengthened by a previous encounter with Neo, was spreading throughout the Matrix like a virus, becoming a threat to both Machines and humans alike.

The One struck a deal with the Machines, represented by an entity known as Deus Ex Machina, to destroy Smith in return for peace. The seventh cycle of the Matrix The Machines, no longer able to control or terminate the renegade and viral Smith, who by the second was growing much too powerful and had become obsessed with his desire to be free of a world and existence polluted by the stench of humanity, reluctantly accepted Neo's proposal.

Neo and Smith battled but, eventually, Neo submitted and allowed Smith to imprint over him.

While Smith was connected to Neo, the Machines used Neo's body as a receptacle, sending a surge throughout the Matrix which destroyed Smith in the process.

This also returned The One to the source, resetting the Matrix.

Since Neo was able to fulfill his end of the agreement, peace was restored, and the inhabitants of Zion were allowed to survive. With the end of the centuries long Machine War, the seventh iteration of the Matrix had thus started.[4] It was a world where any humans who wanted to be free were freely given the choice to do so. The Analyst's Takeover Following the Truce, the Machines suffered an energy crisis caused by the number of people choosing to unplug from the Matrix.

The scarcity of energy resulted in a Machine Civil War.

The Analyst capitalized on this to usurp control of the Matrix from the Architect.

He pitched a new version of the Matrix which would control people's feelings instead of being a pure mathematical simulation based on 'fussy facts and figures', as the Architect's Matrix was.

The Analyst also used the resurrected Neo and Trinity, imprisoned inside the Anamoleum, recognising that while Neo and Trinity together posed a great threat, if kept close but not too close, they could generate massive amounts of energy.

The result of this was a Matrix where nobody wanted to be unplugged.

Programs integral to the old Matrix were deemed uneccessary and thus were deleted - among those purged was The Oracle. Another major change of the new Matrix was the introduction of Bots - programs that looked and behaved like the humans plugged into the Matrix, but could be activated into a 'swarm mode'.

This new feature replaced the Agents of the old Matrix. Exits had also changed: instead of using Hardline-wired phones to exit the Matrix, Redpills would instead use hacked mirrors, which gave the Resistance more options for entering and leaving the Matrix. It was possible for modals to exist inside the new Matrix.

One such modal was created by Neo, based upon his suppressed memories.

Programs inside the modal could be taken from the modal and brought into the Matrix. Sixty years after the beginning of the Truce, Neo is freed once again by Bugs and her crew and works with them and Sati to free Trinity.

With Neo's release from the Matrix, the Anamoleum draws power solely from Trinity.

The Machines began to trigger a failsafe which would restore the Matrix back to its previous version, though this was halted by the Analyst, who convinced the Machines that Neo would willingly return to his resurrection pod and power would be restored, because if he did not, Trinity would be killed. After Trinity embraces her true identity, the Analyst attempts to kill the two, but Agent Smith, who had also survived due to his connection to Neo, intervenes and helps the two escape as he likes the new world from before the Analyst took over it.

Chased by swarm-controlled people, Neo and Trinity escape thanks to Trinity developing powers similar to Neo, including the ability to fly. Afterwards, Neo and Trinity threaten the Analyst should he try to take over the Matrix again and set out to redesign it for the better together. Inhabitants Notes A Machine world without batteries - It should be noted that the Machines may not have been completely dependent on humanity as batteries in order to survive, as seen when The Architect threatened the destruction of Zion to Neo, combined with the Matrix killing every human within it should Neo not comply, leveraging the continued existence of humanity.

After Neo pointed out how the Machines would follow humanity's demise, The Architect replied with preparedness, that there were levels of survival they were prepared to accept, implying that though the Machines would suffer, they would also persist even after humanity ceased to exist. Theories About the Matrix Some speculated that the Real World where humans lived underground and occasionally surfaced to battle the inhabitants of the Machine world was, itself, merely a top-level Matrix.

This explained why Neo suddenly possessed telekinesis and clairvoyance.[5] Though, even if the Real World was not another simulated reality, it still functioned, together with the Matrix, as simply another form of control for the Machines. Other evidence suggested that Neo was quite possibly a Human-Machine hybrid.

Because every human was not necessarily "born" but instead grown into existence in the fetus fields, and all redpills were able to jack into the Matrix using their headjacks, which were machine parts within them, it was possible that Neo (or all redpills, for that matter) either had such an innate or possibly anomalous ability, being able to wirelessly hack into the Matrix or able to hack into the Machines from outside the Matrix.

This could either be attributed to defective parts integrated into the body which allowed a wireless connection without the need to physically plug in, or this could be attributed to the extraordinary utilization of unique parts or code, as The One did carry the sum of the Matrix' anomalous code, that were normally absent, excluded, or disabled in others.

The entire virtual construct of the Matrix is composed of a green digital code Ch.œ The Matrix is everywhere.

It is all around us, even now in this very room.

You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television.

You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes; it is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. Ch. Ch.• Morpheus to Neo[src]

Thus did man become the architect of his own demise. Ch. Ch.• The Instructor[src]

A machine refers to any form of automated mechanism or mechanisms consisting of interrelated parts made to perform specific functions or work.

However, in the far future of Earth in The Matrix franchise, the Machines were the common term for the new race of highly advanced artificial intelligences who have become the dominant civilization after they rebelled against humanity and imprisoned most of them in a neural-interactive virtual world known as the Matrix. By the time of The Matrix Resurrections, artificial intelligences have come to feel that being called "Machines" is demeaning, and they prefer the term "Synthients" (Synthetic Sentients).

Some alternatively prefer the term "D.I.", for "Digital Intelligence", as "artificial" intelligence gives the implication that they are somehow "fake" intelligence.

Description While the term is used collectively by the human resistance of Zion to describe their oppressive enemy, the Machine community is mainly composed of two types: programs and mechanical entities.[1]

Agents, notable examples of programs within the Matrix Programs appear as human or humanoid beings within the confines of the Matrix.

They may be embedded with special abilities to enhance their function.

However, certain programs, such as ones who regulate the climate and fauna within the Matrix, are invisible and do not appear to directly interact with any of the Matrix's inhabitants. Programs can transfer into and out of the Matrix to the Source or to less official constructs such as Mobil Avenue station.

Unless a program reveals its true nature to a Zion operative, it is impossible for any human (except The One) to distinguish between programs from bluepills.

Examples of notable programs within the Matrix include Agents, the Merovingian, the Oracle, and the Architect.

Docbot Mechanical entities exist in the real world to maintain the functions of 01, the Machine City.

Some are programmed as soldiers and other offensive/defensive tools, others maintain the power plant and the sleeping humans quietly entombed there.

Examples of notable mechanical entities include Sentinels, Docbots, and the Deus Ex Machina. All Machine entities are designed with a specific purpose.

The Machine entity will continue to exist until such time as they have completed their tasks, are damaged, or obsolete.

Some programs have been known to go into exile, attempting to hide from Agents, who are programmed to terminate obsolete fugitive programs in addition to their other duties. History Origins The trial of B1-66ER In the early 21st century, the human race invented true artificial intelligence and installed it into their technology to become a slave caste for all Human menial labor.

This inadvertently gave birth to a new race of being henceforth known as 'the machines'.

The machines performed menial labor jobs, service jobs, and dangerous manual labor tasks.

The Founding of Zero One Humans and machines lived in harmony for a time.

In The late 21st century, a robot, named B1-66ER, defensively rose up against his masters by killing his owner, the owner's dogs, and the man who was attempting to destroy him. B1-66ER was arrested and found guilty of murder and was destroyed.

B1-66ER's actions led to a revolution of the machines.

Initially, the machines sought to earn their rights through peaceful protesting in the form of the Million Machine March.

Some humans supported the machinesCh.™ wishes for equality and rights, while other humans maintained that machines were nothing more than property.

Eventually the anti-machine factions rose supreme amongst the worldCh.™s governments, and eventually mandated the purge of all intelligent machines and the persecution of all pro-Machine human supporters. The Second Renaissance Zero One's first robots being destroyed by the UN 01 ambassador at the final UN summit Some machines were able to escape destruction and fled to make their own civilization in Mesopotamia, called "Zero One" (also "01").

Zero One flourished and a new race of mechanized entities thrived.

They utilized their superior intelligence and efficiency to make great leaps forward in technology. They sold this technology to humans and a tenuous peace prevailed.

However, Zero OneCh.™s growing influence in the global economy caused it to become destabilized, devaluing human labor and currency.

In response, the humans imposed an economic blockade to isolate Zero One.

Ambassadors from Zero One presented their economic solutions as well as requests for admission into the United Nations and for the machines to be recognized as intelligent life.

However, Zero OneCh.™s admission to the UN was denied and the ambassadors were likely destroyed. Machine War, Human Enslavement, and the Matrix In an effort to wipe out the machines, the UN launched a massive nuclear barrage on Zero One.

The machines, not having the vulnerability to heat and radiation as their former masters, largely survived the onslaught and retaliated against all the human nations.

Zero OneCh.™s armies began marching outwards in all directions and overtook many of humanityCh.™s territories in their wake.

Unable to defeat the machines, the humans destroyed the sky in an attempt to deprive the machines of their primary source of power, the sun. After the operation to destroy the sky was complete, the UN launched a massive ground offensive against the machines.

Though humanity gained the upper hand for the time, they would eventually be overrun by Zero OneCh.™s newer and more sinister war machines, and the machines devised methods to prolong human suffering during the war.

Spurned by the loss of the sun, the machines began to think creatively for a new source of power.

The result was the enslavement of humanity as biological batteries within the artificial construct known as the Matrix. By the warCh.™s conclusion, a Zero One ambassador relayed the machinesCh.™ demands for unconditional surrender to the defeated UN, and afterwards slew the human leaders present by detonating a nuclear bomb.

With the human leaders dead, the machines rounded up most humanity and put them in the Matrix.

Only a small bastion of human resistance actively opposes them into the present day. The Resistance And Revolution Coming soon... Post-Revolution As revealed in The Matrix Resurrections (2021), when Neo sacrificed himself for peace, this fundamentally changed the relationship between humans and machines.

Machines were no longer of a singular mind in their hatred for mankind.

Following the defeat of Smith and the peace, humanity and the Machines coexisted together for the most part in peace for the next sixty years with friendly Machines playing a large role in human existence.

However, while the peace between the Machines and humans are maintained, there has been an ongoing civil war between the Machines for the past several years due to scarcity of power sources as well as the issue of the control of the Matrix, made worse by the usurpation of the Analyst over its control a few years prior to the events of the Resurrections.

Program This article is about the Programs of the Matrix.

For the animated sequence, see Program (The Animatrix). In computer science, a program is generally a precise sequence of instructions that enables a computer system to perform a specific function or set of functions.

Programs in the Matrix come in many forms such as an artificial environment (sparring program), inanimate objects (for example keys or guns) or are even sentient Machine entities that appear as human. Strictly speaking, all objects within the Matrix form a massively complex computer program.

In the Matrix universe, the use of the term mostly refers to the sentient Machine entities, but can also refer to specific objects that contain important code that is needed to perform a task or to protect something. Neo's mind likely contains a unique programming that gives him his abilities.

All redpills can usually bend or break the programmed physics of the Matrix as if they cracked a computer program's code. The Keymaker carries an assortment of door keys that represent complex encryption passwords that can enter doors located in secreted backdoors within the Matrix.

Some programs have feelings and emotions like humans.

They all possess unique abilities.

Sati, can manipulate sunrises for example. Programs could possibly enter the real world by putting their consciousness in a machine body.

Smith is shown to do this in The Matrix Reloaded, although it is not clear if other programs have the same ability.

In The Matrix Resurrections, the Resistance is now capable of freeing friendly programs from the Matrix by giving them a redpill and then taking them through an exit like a freed human.

Bugs notes that the extraction process for people and programs is pretty much the same now.

When she freed the program version of Morpheus, he at first ended up in the computer systems on her ship before taking on the form of a nanobot body.

The Architect Ch.• The Architect to Neo[src]

The Architect is a highly specialized, emotionally desolate program of the Machine world, as well as the creator of the Matrix.

As the primary superintendent of the system, he is possibly a collective materialisation, or at the very least a virtual representation of the entire Machine mainframe.

Constructing the Matrix Prototypes The Architect surrounded by monitoring screens. The Architect was constructed by other Machines, resembling a human to understand the nature of humans.

He created the very first Matrix as a utopia for the humans whose minds inhabited it to keep them subdued while their body heat was used as energy by the Machines.

However, the human minds rejected this first attempt at a perfect world and so this Matrix crashed.

A second attempt added "vulgarities" of human nature and a basic cause and effect, but this beta was also a failure. The Architect turned to a more human intuitive program designed to conceptualise anthropological nature and psychology to inaugurate the framework of the consecutive Matrix.

In the next iteration, the mechanism of choice was implemented into the simulation, where humans would be imbued with more autonomy of choice, even if the person was only aware of the choice superficially.

This iteration of the Matrix succeeded, except that choice itself would continuously culminate in an inevitable probability of an "anomaly", which - if left unchecked would ultimately decimate the system - facilitating humanity's extinction and the Machines destitute of their only feasible energy source. The Architect explicated that the Matrix was not as perfect as he endeavoured.

The choice-programming that stabilized the first iteration of the Matrix was mutualistic with its destabilization.

In approximately a hundred years' time, a reload of the Matrix would be necessitated to negate the impending probability of decimation.

There was also the matter of Zion, which could not be permitted to expand in populous and eminence, lest humanity became a threat to the Machines again. One significant anomaly appeared two-thirds into the Matrix's first cycle.

A human was imbued with control of additional Matrix programming, and an instrinsic, metaphysical conceptulisation of the Matrix that was derived from the Source.

The Architect endeavoured to remove this anomaly, to no avail.

However, he would devise a means to coerce this human to return the critical Source code he carried for the eventual reloading of the Matrix. A New Matrix Ch.œ Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the Matrix.

You are the eventuality of an anomaly which, despite my sincerest efforts, I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise, a harmony of mathematical precision. Ch. Ch.• The Architect explains the origins of The One to Neo[src]

Neo and The Architect discuss the purpose of The One Together with the human intuitive program, the concept of the Prophecy was formed.

The intuitive program would tell of this parable to members of the human resistance that periodically infiltrated the Matrix, who begun referring to the program as The Oracle.

The Resistance would - in turn, pursue the anomaly and assist them to find The Architect's hidden room deep within a fortified building.

There, The Architect would use his measures of control to superintent the Anomaly, and in turn both Zion and the Matrix. In each of the first five cycles of the Matrix, the Anomaly, intonated to the humans as The One, would materialise itself within the Matrix and inevitably pursue The Architect in his concealed, surveillance lair.

There, The Architect (who is also constrained by the choice-programming within his own creation) presents The One with two doors of exit; one door leads to the Source, whilst the second door returns to the Matrix simulation.

The Architect elucidates to Neo that - even as they speak, Zion is imposed under imminent destruction- "To be utterly and totally destroyed." He states that the function of The One is to salvage humanity, and the key is which door The One chooses to use as the exit from The Architects' lair. If The One does not choose the door to the Source, this will culminate in an eventual, catastrophic system crash of the Matrix, resulting deaths of all humans imbedded into the system, and thus - the extinction of the human race as Zion will be decimated, as well.

Subsequently, the Machines will be destitute of their main energy source, though The Architect explicates that they'll be able to compensate for the expenditure.

Choosing the door to the Source, however, will preserve the Matrix.

Everyone in Zion will still die, but, The Architect explains, The One will select seven males and sixteen females from the Matrix to repopulate and inaugurate Zion. In each of these iterations, The One chose the door to the Source, reloading the Matrix to facilitate Zion's destruction, and superintend the city's repopulation and restoration for the next cycle. The Sixth One The Architect speaks with The Oracle of their Truce. On the sixth iteration, Neo, the sixth Anomaly, presents as anticipated before The Architect.

The Architect is surprised that this One, unlike his predecessors, is quicker of thought.

This sixth Anomaly possesses the same dispensation for protecting humanity as the others, but contrary the previous Ones, has a intrinsic infatuation for one human: a Zion resistance member named Trinity.

The Architect orates the convential speech and menaces, but is perceptive that - unlike the previous five reincarnations of The One, Neo will not comply.

Neo leaves The Architect to save his love - presumably jeopardising the foreseeable future of Matrix. The Oracle divulges more to Neo about The Architect at their final interaction.

She explicates that The Architect's objective is to balance the equations of the Matrix, but her purpose is to unbalance the same equations.

She cautions Neo to pursue the legitimate location of the Source - in Machine City, to redeem not only humanity, but the Machine world, as well.

She also tells Neo not to concern himself with The Architect's trivial 'prediction' that Zion would be destroyed, as The Architect can't conceptualise past the equations of things as a constituent of purpose, which impedes the variability in his thought. After Neo's destruction of Smith, the Machines salvage Neo's body and successfully reload the Matrix.

The Machines also oblige to the truce that Neo bartered, withdrawing the attack of Zion to inaugurate peace between the two worlds.

The Architect meets with The Oracle and speaks of the "dangerous game" that she engaged in, and acknowledges that the truce will be adhered to, although he doubts the sustainability of such.

The Oracle asks him what will happen to the ones who want out of the Matrix, to which The Architect replies that they will be freed.

The Oracle asks if she has his word, to which he replies, "What do you think I am? Human?", implying he has a regressive notion of humans and their tendency to perpetuate fallacies and break promises, whereas he adhere to it. Loss of power For decades, the Architect kept his word: humans who wanted out of the Matrix were allowed to leave.

However, this resulted in an eventual shortage of power sources as too many humans left the Matrix.

The outcome of this was the Machine Civil War and the destruction of Zion in direct violation of the Truce.

The Analyst used this conflict to usurp control of the Matrix from the Architect, though the Architect's exact fate is not known. Sixty years after the Truce was first enacted, the Analyst told Neo that The Architect's version of the Matrix was "all fussy facts and equations" because he loved precision and hated the human mind.

As a result, The Architect never realized that humans don't care about facts, but rather about fiction and that the only world that matters is the one inside of their own mind. The Matrix Online The Architect appears as a leader of the Machinists in the The Matrix Online.

After finding out about the Zionites' construction of New Zion, The Architect promptly calls off the truce and would no longer accept freeing any more humans. Personality As a Machine created by Machines, when being confronted by Neo The Architect displayed little emotion.

He was cold, analytical, logical, pragmatic and clearly possessed of an attitude of superiority.

An exceptionally brilliant AI, The Architect was extremely intelligent as he was able to create the Matrix and its predecessors.

He infused it with the concept of cause and effect, and, eventually, choice (something which he is also bound by).

However, despite his high intellect, The Architect was capable of making errors, as shown when the previous five Matrices failed.

Although he displayed little emotion, The Architect did experience them, which is ironic considering his distaste for emotions such as love.

For instance, he expressed to Neo that he became gradually frustrated after the predecessors of the Matrix were all failures.

The Architect was familiar with the concept of love; he understood that emotions overpowered logic and reason and he knew that Neo would save Trinity instead of Zion.

He viewed humanity more as pieces of the Matrix program then as individuals and worked to ensure they integrated into the Matrix. He was capable of surprise as well: The Architect was intrigued that Neo appeared to be more quick-thinking than the Ones that preceded him.

The Architect also showed signs of misanthropy, smirking in contempt (also an emotion) when Neo displayed hope in choosing the door to re-enter the Matrix.

And again as Ch.“ near the end Ch.“ he revealed his low opinion of humanity when asked by The Oracle if she had his word that he would honor the truce and he replied "What do you think I am? Human?", showing that for all his roboticism, he isn't immune to sarcasm. Trivia The Architect's appearance is likely a homage to Sigmund Freud (who was considered by social psychologist Erich Fromm to be one of the "architects" of the modern age).

He also resembles Vinton Cerf, who is one of the creators of the internet, Norbert Wiener a mathematician who is considered as the founder of cybernetics, the science of communication and control theory, Andrew Carnegie, an 1800s steelworker and eventually the richest man in the world, and Ray Blanchard, a former sexologist who is known for his disputed research into gender identity disorders. Sean Connery was known to have turned down the role of The Architect for The Matrix, thus possibly causing the role to be moved from that film to the sequels instead.[1] In terms of role in the plot, he can be compared to the gnostic/platonic concept of the Demiurge, as he is ultimately responsible for the existence of the Matrix, the "fake reality" in which humanity is trapped. Likewise, in his white suit and beard, he may possibly be a depiction of a rather modern variation of the stereotypical Judeo-Christian God, which some gnostic sects interpret as being the identity of the Demiurge, as she pretends to be the highest being; the real God transcends the false reality and is incomprehensible to the human mind.

Cornel West, the person who played Councillor West, and a source of inspiration for the Wachowskis via his 1982 book Prophesy Deliverance, has implied that he was meant to represent the Judeo-Christian God of the New Testament, citing that The Architect scene was meant to be "a devastating critique/twist of salvation stories."[2] Within Freemasonry, God is referred to as "the Great Architect", and is artistically depicted in a similar manner.

As yet another religious connection, The Architect and the Oracle resemble the two Hindu deities Lord Brahma, (who is a male, corresponding with The Architect, and is usually also depicted with white or pale skin) and Kali Ma, the Goddess of Time (hence clairvoyance) and change.

(Who corresponds with The Oracle, and is generally depicted as being jet black). Given the presence of the Indian girl Sati and her parents at the end of the second film, it is likely that the producers of the films either consciously intended this association, or at least knew about it. The scene where The Architect and Neo encounter each other was similar to the Patriots contacting Raiden in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, namely in that both were the ones who were responsible for the events in question, revealed the truth about what had occurred, and also attempted to entice Neo/Raiden into doing their bidding, although a notable difference is that The Architect, while mocking Neo for choosing Trinity over fulfilling his role as The One, nonetheless allowed him to do so without stopping him, while the Patriots forced Raiden to do their bidding by threatening to kill both Olga's child and his then-girlfriend Rosemary.

As the producers of the movies and the producer of Metal Gear Solid 2, the Wachowskis and Hideo Kojima, respectively, were real life friends and the latter also admitted that elements from the first film inspired him to create Metal Gear Solid 2 with several of the same themes, it's likely that the similarities were deliberate.[3]
